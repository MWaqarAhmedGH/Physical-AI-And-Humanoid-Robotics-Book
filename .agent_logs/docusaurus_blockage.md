I am currently blocked on task T002: "Add the VLA module to the Docusaurus sidebar in `docusaurus.config.js`". The Docusaurus project has not been initialized in this repository.

To proceed, the Docusaurus project needs to be initialized first. This typically involves running a command like `npx create-docusaurus@latest <project-name> classic`.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed:
1.  **Initialize Docusaurus:** Provide instructions on how to initialize the Docusaurus project (e.g., in the `docs/` directory).
2.  **Skip Docusaurus Initialization:** If Docusaurus is not intended to be used or initialized at this stage, please clarify how to proceed with the documentation tasks.
