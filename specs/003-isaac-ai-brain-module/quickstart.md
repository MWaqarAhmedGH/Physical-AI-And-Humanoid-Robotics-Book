# Quickstart: Contributing to the AI-Robot Brain Module

This guide provides a quick overview of how to contribute to the "AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)" module.

## Prerequisites

-   A working installation of ROS 2 Humble.
-   NVIDIA Isaac Sim installed.
-   Familiarity with Python is recommended.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up your development environment**: Ensure that you have a clean ROS 2 workspace and that Isaac Sim is correctly configured to work with ROS 2.
2.  **Explore the existing simulations**: Before making changes, familiarize yourself with the existing Isaac Sim projects and ROS 2 packages.
3.  **Follow the plan**: Refer to the `plan.md` and `tasks.md` files for this feature to understand the scope and a to-do list of items.

## Content Creation Workflow

1.  **Create a feature branch**: Follow the branching model defined in `research.md`.
2.  **Write the content**: Create or edit the Markdown files in the `docs/isaac-ai-brain-module` directory.
3.  **Create or modify simulations**: If you are adding new examples, create the necessary Isaac Sim projects and ROS 2 nodes.
4.  **Test your changes**: Run all simulations and code examples to ensure they work as expected.
5.  **Review and submit**: Once you are happy with your changes, create a pull request.

## Style Guide

-   Follow the asset standards and content consistency guidelines defined in `research.md`.
-   Ensure all code examples are runnable and tested.
-   All claims must be verifiable and cited where appropriate.
